Spring-Heeled Jack's DF repo
============================

Hi there! You seem to have stumbled upon the repo that some friends and I are
using to keep track of our generation fort. Feel free to download and play with
the world we've generated if you're really that amused. Warning: it's
deliberately weird, has some rather steep cliffs, and lots of good and evil
domains. The entire ocean appears to be evil, so watch out for undead whales.
